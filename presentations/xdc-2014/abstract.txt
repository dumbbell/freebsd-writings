Today, FreeBSD is well behind Linux in the graphics stack area, but the
community regains interest in the topic. Users want a beautiful and
friendly desktop environment on their shiny new laptop, they want to try
this Wayland thing all their Linux buddies talk about, and above all,
they want to mine virtual currency and be rich!

But all of this comes with a price: contributors and users hit critical
problems due to the gap with Linux. Some of them are technical, some are
human. Right now, the Linux community leads developments and we need to
learn again how the graphics stack work from top to bottom.

After a short history of major changes, the presentation goes through
the current situation in the kernel, the packages and with our users.
It then concludes with the actions taken and planned to restore a nice
desktop experience on FreeBSD and, in the long term, be part of the
developments, side by side with not only the Linux community but other
platforms too.
